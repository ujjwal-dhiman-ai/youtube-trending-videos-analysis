**Project Report: Data Engineering for YouTube Trending Videos Analysis**

**1. Introduction:**
   - This project aims to analyze YouTube trending videos data from multiple regions across the globe.
   - The data is sourced from Kaggle and consists of CSV files containing video metadata and JSON files containing category information.
   - The project involves several AWS services like S3, Glue, Lambda, Athena, and QuickSight for data ingestion, transformation, analysis, and visualization.

**2. Architecture Overview:**
   - **Data Collection:** 
     - YouTube trending videos data obtained from Kaggle, comprising 10 CSV files for different regions and 10 JSON files for each region containing category information.
   - **Data Storage:**
     - Data uploaded to AWS S3 bucket with a specific structure: raw_statistics for CSV files and category_info for JSON files.
   - **Data Processing:**
     - Utilized AWS Glue crawlers to catalog data and generate tables in AWS Data Catalog.
     - Implemented Lambda function triggered by JSON file uploads to normalize data and store it in Parquet format in another S3 bucket.
     - Conducted schema normalization and conversion of CSV files to Parquet format using AWS Glue ETL jobs.
   - **Data Analysis:**
     - Joined the cleaned datasets using Glue job to create an analytics dataset.
   - **Data Visualization:**
     - Leveraged AWS QuickSight to create insightful dashboards for analyzing YouTube trending videos.

**3. Detailed Steps:**
   - **Data Ingestion:**
     - Acquired YouTube trending videos data from Kaggle.
     - Uploaded data to AWS S3 bucket with a defined structure.
   - **Data Cataloging:**
     - Utilized AWS Glue crawlers to catalog both CSV and JSON data.
     - Generated tables in AWS Data Catalog for raw and cleaned data.
   - **Data Transformation:**
     - Implemented Lambda function triggered by JSON uploads to normalize data and store it in Parquet format.
     - Utilized AWS Glue ETL jobs to normalize schema and convert CSV to Parquet format.
   - **Data Analysis:**
     - Joined datasets using Glue job to create a comprehensive analytics dataset.
   - **Data Visualization:**
     - Created dashboards using AWS QuickSight for analyzing trends in YouTube videos.

**4. Technologies Used:**
   - AWS S3: Storage service for hosting raw and cleaned data.
   - AWS Glue: Used for data cataloging, ETL, and job orchestration.

**5. Challenges Faced:**
   - Handling JSON data: Required normalization for efficient processing.
   - Schema normalization: Ensuring consistency across datasets.
   - Data type conversion: Resolving discrepancies in data types for seamless analytics.

**6. Future Enhancements:**
   - Real-time processing: Implement streaming solutions for immediate data ingestion and analysis.
   - Advanced analytics: Incorporate machine learning models for predictive analytics on trending videos.
   - Scalability: Design infrastructure to handle larger volumes of data efficiently.

**7. Conclusion:**
   - The project successfully demonstrates a comprehensive data engineering pipeline for analyzing YouTube trending videos data.
   - Leveraging AWS services, it achieves efficient data processing, transformation, and analysis.
   - The insights derived from the analytics dataset can provide valuable information for content creators, marketers, and researchers in understanding YouTube trends and user preferences.
